     (1) holders of the Exit-entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao who can complete two doses of vaccination within their limit of stay without extension; ,,,,,,,,,,
     (2) non-refoulement claimants and refugees recognised by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; and ,,,,,,,,,,
"     (3) other visitors staying in Hong Kong (holders of valid travel documents who are allowed to stay in Hong Kong as permitted by the law, and can complete two doses of vaccination within their limit of stay without extension). These non-Hong Kong residents who are eligible to receive vaccination may not be included in the baseline population eligible to receive vaccination.  Separately, the relevant baseline population is not based on real time figures and there may be deviations from the actual situation. Therefore, vaccination rate may be higher than 100%.",,,,,,,,,,
